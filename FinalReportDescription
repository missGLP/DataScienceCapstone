Here's the problem I'd like to solve in this final report:
I'd like to start a coffee store in Toronto, which neighborhood do you think will be a potentially successful location, and why?

What dat to be used and how to analyze?
I will use following data:
1. Boroughs and Neighborhoods defined in Toronto.
2. Explore venues in each neighborhood.
3. Find out which neighborhood has more plaza, parking lot, bus station.
4. Expolre the coffee store in this neighborhood like the ratings, then decide if we have confidence to build a successfull coffee store here.
